# OVERVIEW
This experiment aims to determine the magnetic field strength in a slinky relative to turns and the permeability of free space. The magnetic field strength generated by a current-carrying wire is directly proportional to the number of turns around a given area. This experiment involves measuring the magnetic field strength (B) at different locations along a slinky with varying numbers of turns (N). By using the formula B = µ₀*(N/L) *(I) , we can determine the value of the permeability of free space (µ₀). By rearranging the equation, we can solve for the permeability for free space as µ₀ = (B * L) / (N * I) .

# OBJECTIVES
1. To apply the Biot-Savart law and demonstrate the relationship between the magnetic field strength and the number of turns in a current-carrying slinky.
2. To determine the permeability of free space using the data and the magnetic field measurements obtained from the slinky.

# How to use
Fill in the code portions with your data, e.g. L= length, becomes L= 2.
Run each cell in order to ensure the correct values are saved in memory.
