Determining the Magnetic Field Strength in a Slinky Relative to its Turns and the Permeability of Free Space.

# OVERVIEW
This experiment aims to determine the magnetic field strength in a slinky relative to turns and the permeability of free space. The magnetic field strength generated by a current-carrying wire is directly proportional to the number of turns around a given area. This experiment involves measuring the magnetic field strength (B) at different locations along a slinky with varying numbers of turns (N). By using the formula B = µ₀*(N/L) *(I) , we can determine the value of the permeability of free space (µ₀). By rearranging the equation, we can solve for the permeability for free space as µ₀ = (B * L) / (N * I) .
